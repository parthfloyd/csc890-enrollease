EnrollEase addresses a critical need in higher education by revolutionizing the enrollment process for both students and enrollment offices within CSU institutions. With the aim of enhancing student engagement, streamlining communication, and boosting enrollment targets by up to 50%, EnrollEase serves as an AI Enrollment Assistant. For community college students transitioning to universities, the lack of engagement and guidance, particularly in departments like financial aid, remains a significant challenge.
